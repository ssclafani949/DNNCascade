The contained files are the data release to accounty the manuscript
'Observation of High-Energy Neutrinos from the Galactic Plane'.

Refer to Publication for further details on how to use these files.

The directory contains for folders:

Main Result
Fig2
Fig3
Fig4

They reproduce the main paper results, and provide digitized versions to remake
all figures:

All figures have an accomponying Jupyter Notebook to show an example of usage
All files are saved as .csv whereever possible

The formating for below is as follows:
